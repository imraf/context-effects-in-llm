They had the unique ability to disappear swiftly and silently when they didn't wish to meet someone, which they attributed to heredity, practice, and a close friendship with the earth rather than any magical skills. Hobbits were smaller than Dwarves, with variable heights ranging between two and four feet, but typically shorter nowadays. They were relatives of Men, closer than Elves or Dwarves, and had spoken languages similar to Men in their own way.
