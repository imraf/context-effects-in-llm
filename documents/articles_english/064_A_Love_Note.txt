----------------------------------------
I’ve been going to sleep waiting to wake up just to see if I still love you, and I still do. Not in the same way that I used to, but I was mad that I woke up thinking about you. Lately, when I wake up I ask myself, “Do I still love him?” But this morning, I was mad that I didn’t have to.

I had a dream and you were in it. We didn’t speak but I could feel the love you still have for me emanating from your heart. The sad part is that I wanted to bathe in it, but It didn’t feel right. The love felt conditional, like it was going to leave with time. I felt rushed to capture it all in an embrace. I couldn’t enjoy the experience because my soul heard the clock ticking. I know your love for me is authentic, and I never doubted that for a second, but it never truly felt mine.

For some reason it’s easier this time. To be okay just feels okay. Although I’m staying present, when I blink, I do still see you. Even though I can still feel you, I continue to just look straight ahead. I won’t let myself get wrapped in what we had.
