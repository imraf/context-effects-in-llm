Looking back at your past mistakes consistency is hard, in fact really difficult but as Tony Robbins says, ‘The key to an extraordinary life, is to raise your standards’.

I’m taking time out this weekend to reflect on the good, the bad, and the in-between, growth is not a linear path, it’s full of peaks and valleys. Hindsight is certainly 2020 and in the year that 2020 has been, I’m sure there are things we would have all done differently. The clearest way to show we have learnt from our mistakes is to not make them again and take actions that reflect the new self we have chosen. That’s something I’m really proud I have done, even if the method of wish I learnt those lessons are some of the hardest I have ever had to endure.

In your efforts to become someone better, it’s good to take stock of how far you have come, your moments of strength, and your moments of weakness.

This period of the year is good to get ahead of New Year’s resolutions, make plans for the year ahead, but also revisit what’s happened in the present, and I’m sure this one for all of us is one that is uniquely different.

What I will be doing to reflect on this year?

Writing in my diary Meditating Taking walks

All of these require alone time, which I think everyone should have resonablyy frequently, I may be saying that from the perspective of someone who enjoys moments of solace but I genuinely believe spending time with yourself and on yourself is one of the most important things you can do.

What standout moment do you look back on this year?
