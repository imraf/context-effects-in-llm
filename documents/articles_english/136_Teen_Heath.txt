----------------------------------------
Relating to my hair being shorter and my families immediate reaction to assuming it’s my health.

Seventeen years old

Within less than three days these are the changes my family has decided for me.

I’m on three vitamins now. I have to take two of each.

I’m on a strict diet. All those fun healthy foods. Sweets only for desert. If any.

Multiple sources of protein a day

If I’m away from the house I should send pictures of what I’m eating so they know I’m eating how I’m supposed to be

Only water really throughout the day

Other drinks have too much sugar

If I am to have sweets I need to have eaten enough of fruits in vegetables.

Small amounts of carbs, they don’t have enough nutrients to be considered healthy
