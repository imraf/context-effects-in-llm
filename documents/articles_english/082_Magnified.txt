Perhaps missing you is easier than missing her now

You’re accessible

And tangible

And somewhere to be found

She’s gone from here

So searching wouldn’t do any good

So instead I’ll attach to you

More value than I probably should

My feelings for you are still real

They’re just magnified

By the other feelings of abandonment that I try to hide

And when I admit them I feel like it seems so cliche

Past trauma doesn’t excuse behaviour today

Yet here I am so triggered that I could fucking scream

Part of me wants to stay composed

And the other wants to cause a scene

A piece of me is broken

But don’t worry, another part of me is tough

So rough around the edges, but I’m afraid its not enough

I want to heal all of the open wounds

But I’ll keep all of the lessons

Perhaps the turbulence is how the universe

Reminds us that we are sentient
