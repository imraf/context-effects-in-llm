The exhibition titled Thin as Thorns, In These Thoughts in Us: An Exhibition of Creative AI and Generative Art organized by the Honor Fraser Gallery in Los Angeles, aims to investigate the various implications that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has in the cultural and artistic fields.

The title of the exhibition comes from a computer-generated book of poetry called Articulations and designed by artist, poet and programmer Allison Parrish. The exhibition features a series of very different works by artists who have used AI both as a medium and a tool to create.

In this exhibition, open until February 20, 2021, you will find the works of various artists, including: Patrick Tresset, Christobal Valenzuela, Joanne Hastie, Agnieszka Kurant, Annie Lapin, Allison Parrish, Memo Akten, Sougwen Chung, Chris Coy, YACHT, Holly Grimm, Casey Reas, Siebren Versteeg and Tom White. Included in the show there are also two works by pioneers Harold Cohen and Roman Verostko.

The exhibit intends to provide the public with tools to approach this type of art and to understand its intrinsic aspects. Due to the current situation, the exhibition can be visited only by appointment.
