Build a home

Build a place

A place for peace

A place that’s free

Free from Kings,

Free for all.

All becomes good

All are now one.

One it grows power

One it lays rules.

Rules that are cool

Rules that are cruel.

Cruel starts to fester

Cruel starts to grow.

Grows to take over,

Grows to take hold.

Hold in their hands

Hold of their lives.

Lives on the line

Lives out of sight.

Sight the desperation

Sight out the hurt

Hurt in the heart

Hurt on the back

Back of the mind,

Back of what’s black

Black as a sentence

Black is a human.

Human. A person.

Human, we are?

We are just people.

We are not god.

God, you pretend

God made the rules.

The rules are still cruel

The rules have screwed you.

Screw you for not changing,

Screw you for your lies.

Your lies have unraveled,

Your lies eat a life.

A life may have fallen,

A life is still worthy.

Worthy of movement,

Worthy of change.

Change that must happen,

Change they scream now.

Now it must happen!

Now! It screams out.
