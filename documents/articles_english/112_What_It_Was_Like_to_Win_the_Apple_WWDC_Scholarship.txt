What It Was Like to Win the Apple WWDC Scholarship in 2019

Documenting the process of creating the submission project

WWDC 2019

June 4, 2018

I remember going through the WWDC website to watch the keynote on my MacBook Air.

I wished I could watch it live someday. So, during the intro music, I started exploring the site to understand how the developers get a ticket for it. It was $1,600 for a developer, based on a lottery system. Ummm, no. I scrolled down and found this on the homepage.

“Scholarships — Students and STEM organization members can apply to receive a conference ticket, lodging, and one year of membership in the Apple Developer Program.”

Ahh, this is what I am looking for!

But now I would have to wait for a year to apply. I went through the requirements, a full project on Xcode Playgrounds/Swift Playgrounds with some essays. I had just started iOS Development, and my experience with Playgrounds was limited to declaring a few variables. And only 350 students were selected from all over the world, ranging from school students to PhDs. This seemed difficult, and so I gave up.
