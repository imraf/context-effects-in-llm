Qatar’s Attorney General has ordered the arrest of Finance Minister Ali Shareef al Emadi as part of an investigation in which Emadi is accused of misuse of public funds and abuse of power. Al Emadi was the Qatari Finance Minister since 2013. Al Emadi is also a member of the powerful sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority, which manages the revenues from the sales of liquefied natural gas, of which the country is the world’s largest exporter.

The arrest was unusual as allegations of criminal conduct by senior state officials or members of ruling families in the Gulf are typically addressed behind closed doors

An unnamed source in Doha, that the charges against him involve corruption and commissions related to government contracts. Observers believe the minister was arrested after the disclosure of money transfers from banks and charities affiliated with Qatar to terrorist groups and organizations in Syria and Iraq in the form of charitable aid, proselytizing activities of the Brotherhood through the Qatar Charity.
