Never Known in November

So begins the season of the Ice Queen

The ice queen comes on whispered wings

I hear her at the door

As the veil of dark and light

Begins to close once more

Her face the color of death and doom

Her eyes in shades of grey

Her breath as cold as frozen fire

Her touch is black decay

She’ll soon possess the hills and dales

And blanket them in snow

She’ll strip the trees and fields alike

And freeze the ground below

She’ll shun the sun within the sky

She’ll fill it full of clouds

She’ll make the moon the brightest boon

Within the misted shrouds

Though Samhain has come and gone

I pray you will remember

How long before the spring returns

Is never known in November
