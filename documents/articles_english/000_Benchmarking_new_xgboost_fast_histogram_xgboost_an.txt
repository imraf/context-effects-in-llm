----------------------------------------
We have seen previously that the new xgboost fast histogram method had an issue: it was awfully slow. But we fixed it. By recompiling R with gcc 7.1.

How do you call someone compiling R from scratch in Windows?

Compiling R was something tough, but I have now an executable I can use on all my servers to deploy R with gcc 7.1 without any issue:

Even better, all libraries are compiled with gcc 7.1 !

! It makes the new xgboost fast histogram fly!

Therefore, we are going to benchmark two different things from xgboost:

xgboost old fast histogram with gcc 4.9 (Rtools) and gcc 7.1 (MinGW)

with gcc 4.9 (Rtools) and gcc 7.1 (MinGW) xgboost new fast histogram with gcc 7.1 (MinGW)

Comparing xgboost old fast histogram with gcc 4.9 and gcc 7.1

To compare the xgboost old fast histogram with different compilers, we will use:

R/xgboost compiled with gcc 4.9

R/xgboost compiled with gcc 7.1

And no, do not tell me to compile it with something else. It is already difficult enough to compile R in Windows.
