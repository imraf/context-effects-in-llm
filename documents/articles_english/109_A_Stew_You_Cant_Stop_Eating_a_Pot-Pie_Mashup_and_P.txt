Some of you will be prepping for Friday’s Christmas holiday, but I promise, these dishes will be worth the planning and time any day this week. With covid full throttle, they’re also great projects to keep ourselves busy. They’ll also ensure your kitchen smells great and for sure they’ll bring joy. Notice two of the three are from my friend and colleague Daniel Meyer, whose cooking you’ll see more of in the new year. Onward!
