Troj4n wants to “Be Your Everything”

Trojan releases the music video for his single, Be Your Everything

Be Your Everything’s song cover, sourced from Troj4n Muv3nda

For the past year, Troj4n has been making big moves to advance his career. Earlier last year, he released his 7 tracks EP named Looking for Something which is just timeless music. He followed up the release of his EP by releasing two singles namely, “4 am in the Studio” and “Be Your Everything”. Both his singles have helped put his talent on the spotlight.

Late last year, he went on to sign a management deal with Rita Dee Entertainment, an entertainment house owned by the one and only Rita Dee Nephawe. Other artists signed under this entertainment house included Makhadzi, a household brand in Venda.

The release of #BYE music really show how creative he can be and the creativity that was put into this music video also raises standards for all Venda artists hoping to shoot music videos in the future. The visuals on this music video are so clean.

I also wish him a happy birthday.

Check out his new music video and subscribe to his channel.
