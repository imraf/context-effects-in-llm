Assume there are 134 crores of population in India,in that we have about 12 crore cultivators or farmers. In that average monthly income of each farming family is around RS 6000/- .

Almost every government in India trying to solve their problems and giving their basic necessities .Reasons may be anything they are trying by providing various schemes , policies and giving confidence through scholarships and schemes. Every environmental aspect that we studied from our childhood is correct.But in my point what we have to focus is

We need to focus on soil parameter,water problems,climatic predictions and Socio-economic parameters

Fertilizers are mainly for preventing crop from diseases and for nutrients .But applying fertilizers on farms are based on soil nutrients capacity like N,P,K etc.

But they are giving fertilizers like anything.For that latest innovative startups like LeanAgri ..they developed an algorithm on scheduling and every pin pointed works collecting samples from farms and give the proper scheduled on complete needs like,when to do what ,how much quantity from beginning to end

After experimenting on many farms ,If we follow the proper schedule and proper amount fertilizers as give we can increase high profit

We need to get awareness on farmers to follow latest technologies .If we focus on this everything that implemented by government is works as they expected.

Make farming as a compulsory course on their school level
