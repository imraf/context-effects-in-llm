Here is the list of books I read in the year 2020. Jumping and touching different themes allow me to witness the world through new lenses for fresh perspectives. It is interesting to know “How a behavioral scientist or a philosopher looks at the advancement of AI?”

All of these books were not published this year, few were a bit old but full of insights. Time constraints did not allow me for deeper introspection but my markers are ready to help me recover the lost grounds. I may not agree with all the ideas presented in these books but it provides a good opportunity for discussions (with authors) on the topics I rarely visit.
