taken aside from the distracting tide

which fuels the time so she can decide

where to pull the strings, where to guide the story,

while the fool assumed a golden “SORRY!”

A bow aiming downward, painted in blood,

shooting sorrows dressed untainted, aloud

the whistle calls for murder till the hit,

impact betrays the hook on the burnished bit,

the offence predestined to miss the heart,

Fate, yet unsatisfied with the victim’s part,

charmed the weakling like a snake charmer without fail.

Toothless looser fell in love with its own tail,

he confusedly hugged his time to bide,

taken aside from the distracting tide
